# Magick Eraser with R


I am always intrigued by these kind of Black markers used to hide some information. So a tiny attempt to see if `magick` can do some **magic with R**


```{r}
library(magick)

image <- image_read("tweet_linkedin.jpeg")

image %>% 
 image_channel() %>% 
  image_modulate(brightness = 350) %>% 
  image_quantize(max = 80)  %>% 
  image_modulate(brightness = 500)  -> new

images <- c(image %>% image_annotate("Supposedly Hidden", size = 40, gravity = "South", strokecolor = "red") %>% image_border() , 
            new %>%   image_annotate("magick with R", size = 40, gravity = "South", strokecolor = "green") %>% image_border())

image_append(images)


```
